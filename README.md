# <HORISEON LANGING PAGE>

## Description

Horiseon, a marketing agency, came to us with the task of increasing the accessibility of their site. We can achieve this by improving their existing codebase to ensure long-term sustainability. This was primarily done by; consolidating the selectors and properties of the existing CSS, ensuring the navigation bar links are functioning correctly, organising the HTML elements into a semantic structure and including comments  where required to assist in future code development.

The motivation for this, which has become an increasingly important consideration for businesses, is web accessibility. This works two fold. Firstly, it is important as it ensures that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies. Secondly, it can help the website rank higher in search engines like Google. 

Here I learnt an important lesson, that you should adhere to the Scout Rule-always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it. 

Furthermore, I learned to eliminate excess lines of code while refactoring.
